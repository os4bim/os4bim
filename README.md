- 👋 Hi, I’m Yoann
- 💡 I’m interested in Python and MEP 3D modeling
- 👨‍🎓 I’m currently learning Python and Revit API including Revit Python Shell and PyRevit
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on script to improve data processing in Revit, and maybe with Open Source softwares in  the future.

**os4bim** means open source for building information model.

I'm using for production the scripts I'm sharing here, and they make me really save time. Be advised you have to know the basics of Python and Revit to custom them in your own processes.
Even if Revit in not an open source tool, I have to use it for my work.
Maybe one day we will have some open source tool we can use for production but in my opinion it's nor for now. Despite of this there is some nice project like BLender BIM or ifcopenshell we can already use for specific tasks.
